"""Channel-driven merge for the Zone Soundscape override.

Uses each mod's own sound_channels.ltx as the curation signal: a sound "belongs"
in a channel because some mod put it there. For each channel (union of names), it
pools every sound any mod assigns to it, dedups identical sounds by fingerprint,
and keeps the best-quality copy. Channel settings (distance/period) come from the
highest-priority mod that defines the channel.

# No placement-distance clamp. _normalize_blobs ships each file's AUTHORED min/max attenuation verbatim;
# placement is the sound's own source-channel spawn band through the vanilla formula (dd_director emit),
# never derived from this pair. The author's range is trusted (only guard is max > min for the engine
# divide). The distance-baked / constant-volume sounds authored at 300-10000m are meant to play at a steady
# level and stay untouched.


# min_distance floor (2026-08-21, user-approved). The OpenAL layer attenuates every 3D voice by an inverse
# curve keyed on the blob min (AL_REFERENCE_DISTANCE, TargetA.cpp:166; model never disabled). 61% of the
# corpus carries the UNSET default min 1-2 ("whisper"), which costs -25..-33 dB at the felt placement
# distances and silenced the director. The floor raises each file's written min to (ratio x its felt-far
# distance = band_max/2). Authored mins ABOVE the floor are kept verbatim; the floor never lowers anyone.
# FLOOR_MAX_FRAC caps the floor below the blob max so a real fade band survives.
#
# The ratio is not flat. PRINCIPLE (measured, mild-moderate, automated): placement loudness follows crest,
# INVERTED. A sustained low-crest tone carries in air -> higher ratio -> stays present at distance; a sharp
# high-crest transient is a near-field detail -> lower ratio -> stays intimate. Crest is measured per file
# (classification.json). Verified across the corpus: transients (drip 24dB, rats 18, foliage 17) are the
# sharp near-field sounds; the sustained dread (drone/scream/mutant/spook ~6-7dB) carries. The span 0.40-0.60
# centers on the old flat 0.5 (~3 dB spread at the far edge), so nothing shifts dramatically.
