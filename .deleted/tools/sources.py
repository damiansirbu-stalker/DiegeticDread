"""Source registry for the DiegeticDread sound pipeline (n124).

One declarative entry per source pack. Sources are ALWAYS pulled locally by hand - the pipeline never
downloads anything. `url` is a REFERENCE link only (the moddb / origin page), kept for credit and provenance
(readme, licensing). The build reads `path`; a source missing there is reported by `build.py provision` and
must be fetched by you. This keeps every shipped sound traceable to a recorded origin without any network step.

ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING: dedup (dedupe) is mildly order-sensitive, so the entries stay in the exact order
the old hardcoded MODS list used - reordering can change which copy of a duplicate wins and shift the corpus.

Per entry:
  name    - the id used across the pipeline (MODS, provenance, the report).
  path    - local gamedata dir (or the extracted root for standalone builds). What the build reads.
  url     - reference/credit link (moddb addon page or origin). None where there is none (granted-original,
            base game, or just not recorded). Purely informational - nothing fetches it.
  licence - "free": public moddb addon, free with credit. "permission": granted directly, proof in the note.
            "game": base game / standalone STALKER build, credited. "pending": not cleared -> the build STOPS.
