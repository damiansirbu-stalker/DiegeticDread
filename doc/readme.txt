! Reset MCM settings to defaults after updating !

The Zone used to be frightening. Modern soundscape mods sharpened its realism and, in
the trade, stripped the horror. AlifeSpooks puts it back, and hands you a mixer for the
in-world sound the Zone already plays.

Why it is different:
- Old-school horror, restored. The dread the realism packs removed: a scream past the
  treeline, a groan under the ground, wind that carries something wrong.
- Measured, not dumped. Every sound goes through signal analysis for spectral shape,
  loudness, and length, then a three-stage dedup - exact hash, acoustic fingerprint, and a
  waveform cross-correlation that tells a re-encoded copy from a genuinely different sound.
  No junk, no duplicates, no lost variety.
- Never repetitive. Play rates are tuned so a long storm never overlaps into a wall and a
  channel with few sounds is not spammed, and a runtime no-repeat memory means you never
  hear the same call twice - the whole library is heard, not the same 10% on a loop.
- Composes, never duplicates. It adds its sounds INTO the game's own channels with DLTX,
  and never adds a sound your install already plays - matched by hash, by acoustic
  fingerprint, and confirmed by waveform, so even a re-encoded copy of a base sound is
  caught. No collisions, no doubling, no extra density, over GAMMA, vanilla, or any soundscape.
- Provable. An in-game trace logs every sound as it plays, so an Anomaly run and a GAMMA
  run diff cleanly. Every file traces back to its origin mod, folder, filename, channel,
  and exact settings.
- Configurable. MCM volume control of the atmosphere per layer - spooks, screams, mutants,
  storm, wind, rain, underground, and more.
- A director for the atmosphere. Today the mod curates each sound through a measured pipeline,
  then places it and sets its level. Where it goes next is to conduct it. A director hooks into
  Anomaly and reads where you stand as you play, inside or open, dark or under the sun, alone or
  in a crowd, an empty village that should hold people, a lair with mutants near, a safe bar,
  and shapes the soundscape to match: dread where it belongs, quiet where you are safe.
- A larger library. The same measured pipeline is turned on the great STALKER standalones and
  total conversions, Prosectors Project, an old-era build, an old-era build, an old-era build, an old-era build, an old-era build and more, to draw out
  their horror sound and fold it in, deduped against what your install already plays.
- Growing. The director and the wider library are in progress, along with original sounds
  recorded for this mod and scripted dread inside buildings and lairs.

One system in two MCM tabs - Atmosphere, and a Development tab that holds the trace controls
and a reset-to-defaults button.

Atmosphere:
  A dark ambient layer over your untouched engine bed, in two parts.
  Loop is one continuous low bed matched to where you stand: machine and metal in the
  X-Labs, dripping stone in the sewers, storm and rain in bad weather, fog on foggy days,
  a dark drone after dusk, a lighter wind by day.
  Effect is rare one-shot scares placed around you: distant growls and screams, metal
  groans and drips underground, far gunfire and drones in the ruins, owls and dogs and
  crows in the wild, storm and wind.
  Placement is traced from where the source packs used each sound, per level, per hour,
  per weather, then corrected against S.T.A.L.K.E.R. canon: underground labs get only
  tunnel dread, the whisper level is haunted dread and wind, city ruins lean human,
  swamps lean wildlife and fog.
  Fear comes from distance, rarity, and surprise, not volume.

How it is built:
  Every sound is put through signal analysis before it goes in, and the result is proven.
  Whether it becomes a looped bed or a one-shot scare is decided from measured length,
  steadiness (crest factor), and loudness (EBU R128), not from its filename.
  Duplicates collapse to one by a three-stage test: exact hash, then acoustic fingerprint to
  propose re-encoded copies, then a waveform cross-correlation to confirm two files really are
  the same recording before merging - so genuinely different sounds are never merged away.
  Anything your install already plays is excluded the same way, and each loop bed is
  deduped across the channels that feed it, so a continuous bed never loops the same recording.
  Every sound ships exactly as its author made it, no loudness re-encode, so each keeps its
  own volume and distance; a file that lacks that metadata is given it to match its channel.
  A ledger proves no net-new dark sound is missed, and a provenance record maps
  every included sound back to its origin. The whole overlay rebuilds from the packs in one run.
  The pipeline, one command end to end:
    index what your install plays  ->  pool the packs' dark sounds  ->  dedup each channel to
    one copy per recording (hash, fingerprint, waveform)  ->  measure and classify each  ->
    keep every file verbatim  ->  compose the overlay (channels + placement)  ->  prove coverage and origin.
  On the current build that meant 5487 candidate sounds pulled and reduced to 1487 genuinely
  new dark sounds: the waveform test caught 177 re-encoded copies plain hashing kept, every
  sound the game already plays was excluded, and every included sound traces to its origin.

Performance:
  Performance comes first, ahead of any feature. AlifeSpooks composes the engine's own sound
  channels and ships audio verbatim; it adds no per-frame work and changes nothing in the engine
  bed. When a feature cannot fit that budget it is reworked, replaced, or removed with an X-Ray
  engine modification rather than allowed to slow the game.

Installation:
  A DLTX overlay plus a few scripts. Loads at any position, changes nothing in the engine
  bed. Requires 44.1 kHz OGG playback, the Anomaly standard. The MCM and the in-game trace
  need xlibs. Without xlibs the mod still runs, content only.
