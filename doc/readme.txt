[ Hero image: diegeticdread-hero.gif - reactive horror, driven by where you stand and who is near ]

Reset MCM settings to defaults after updating.

The Zone used to be frightening.
Modern soundscape mods traded that dread for realism.
DiegeticDread is my attempt to put the fear back without giving up the fidelity.

It is a dread director, driven by where you stand and who is near. It answers the dread of the place with curated horror sounds.
No random timers, no scripts. The soundscape follows the real state of the game around you.
Some of its horror is interior audio Shrike made for Dark Signal and never released, given straight to this mod.

DiegeticAmbience is its companion.
DiegeticDread plays the horror and vetoes it from the base channels. DiegeticAmbience owns the living nature-and-weather bed it leaves alone.
Run both and the Zone is real and frightening at once.

Three parts.
A director reads the Zone and plays to it.
A veto keeps it from doubling the base ambience.
A measured pipeline builds the sound library.
It needs xlibs to play the sounds. Without xlibs it is inert.


1. The director

Where you stand and how much dread the place carries drive it.
WHERE you stand decides which sounds can play.
How much DREAD the place carries decides how close, how often, and which of them play.
A base in daylight is silent. A lab with a mutant near at night is loud and close. Most of the Zone sits between.

Where you are, checked in order.
Each level has a curated list of what belongs on it, traced from the source packs.
A lab plays facility and machine sound. A swamp plays its own mutant atmosphere. A wild forest never plays the radio signal.
A base near, marked by a live service NPC, cancels everything and goes silent, whatever faction owns it.
The enclosure filters the rest. Outdoor never plays doors or machinery. An interior never plays leaves or wind.

Dread itself is one plain sum, no multiplier and no floor.
It adds the level's baseline, how enclosed you are, the hour, and the single scariest thing near, then subtracts your own people around.
The baseline is the dread a place carries alone, grim in the psi north and the labs, mundane in the fields.
The scariest thing near is one reading. A man and a monster of the same strength weigh the same.
True isolation weighs a little on its own.
Allies near are the only thing that calms you, so a place with your people falls quiet while a grim empty one still carries its dread.
Dread places a sound closer and fires it more often as it rises.
It never changes the sound's own level, only how near it plays, and never so far that it falls silent.

The palette.
Sounds fall into categories, each playing only where it fits and only when its condition holds.
Spooks, screams, and dark drones play wherever the map allows.
Mutant calls need a mutant present. Gunfire needs a person. The radio signal needs a signal source nearby.
Wind, foliage, and eerie wildlife are outdoor texture. Doors, machinery, drips, and facility sound belong indoors and underground.
Each category rotates so a scare stays rare against the texture and no call plays twice in a row.
Dread also chooses within a category.
By default a sound plays at every dread level.
You can hold a calm sound to quiet scenes and a scare to tense ones, so the palette shifts as the dread climbs.
That tuning is per-sound, hand-set, and separate from the audio, so it survives every rebuild of the library.

The director places each sound in 3D around and above you, at the distance its own author chose.
It uses the same placement the game's ambient system uses, so a sound plays as it did in the mod it came from.
A sound meant to come from overhead still does.
Every sound is mono, the only form the engine places in 3D, so nothing sticks flat at your ear.
A long drone or the radio signal plays as a spaced sound on a long period.


2. The veto

If you also run a soundscape pack it drew from, that pack's ambient plays the same sounds.
DiegeticDread removes its own sounds from the base's ambient channels, so only its curated version plays, under its director.
It does this statically at config load, with a generated overlay that strips each of the mod's sounds out of every base channel that lists it, at the path each source pack files it under.
A sound can ship in more than one pack. The copies include exact reships and re-encodes. It removes every one. Whichever pack you run, the base loses its version.
The base keeps everything else it plays.
It removes exact sounds only. It leaves every folder, channel, wind bed, and creature call the mod does not carry.
It is one config change at load, so it costs nothing while you play and no other script can strip it.
Whichever base you run, it keeps its own atmosphere.


3. The source and the measured pipeline

Measurement drives every choice here, not taste.
The build is a reproducible pipeline, one command end to end.
It measures every sound before it goes in.
ffmpeg reads its spectral centroid, flatness, crest factor, integrated loudness in EBU R128 LUFS. ffprobe reads its duration, sample rate, codec.
Each pack's folders map to horror categories by hand, and the build pulls every file in them, so it misses nothing the pack buries.
The build drops a sound too long to play whole. It slices the long radio-signal bed into short pieces.
Each file keeps its author's own loudness, the X-Ray gain set in the ogg comment, written back unchanged. No leveling.
The authored levels are tight and field-tested in the source mods, so the corpus already plays even.
Dread comes from where the director places a sound, not from re-leveling one file against the next.
The gain is a number in the header, so the audio is never re-encoded.

Identity is the waveform, decided in three stages, cheapest first.
An md5 hash collapses byte-identical reships.
A Chromaprint fingerprint proposes the re-encoded copies the hash misses, but its ranges overlap, so it only proposes.
A PCM cross-correlation decides. It decodes both files and lines them up by envelope. It then correlates over the overlap. A re-encode scores near 1.0, a different sound near 0.
Files merge only under complete linkage, so a similarity chain never collapses two real recordings and variety holds.
This runs among the source packs only.
The mod never drops a sound because your install already plays it. It carries the full corpus and removes the base copy at load instead.

Mono ships byte for byte, audio untouched, carrying its author's volume and distance band in the ogg comment.
Stereo is the one exception. The engine cannot place it in 3D, so the build folds it to mono and then writes the comment, the author's values captured before the fold.
A file that lacks that metadata gets it losslessly, the median of its category band, so only the header changes.
Most of this corpus never played where it came from.
Their packs carried two thirds of the files but wired them into no channel, so their own schedulers never played them.
Most of the rest carry an unset engine distance field that silences a sound more than a few meters away.
The build corrects that one field to the game's own far-ambience standard.
Thousands of sounds that existed only as files on disk now play in the world, at their author's loudness, for the first time.
A fitness gate keeps 44.1 kHz vorbis, the X-Ray standard, and accounts anything dropped.
A ledger proves the build misses no dark sound.
A provenance record maps every shipped sound back to its origin mod, folder, and name, self-verified by audio hash. Nothing loses its origin.
The director reads cheap signals every few seconds, never per frame, then caches them. The cost stays a slow timer whatever is on screen.


MCM:
Three tabs.
Atmosphere holds one master volume for the mod's sounds plus rarity.
That volume also balances the horror against your base ambience.
The mod plays each sound at its author's loudness and never touches the base.
So if your soundscape mod sits louder or quieter, this slider sets the dread against it.
There are no per-category sliders.
Visuals toggles the screen distortion at peak dread.
Development holds the trace level, a log flush, the debug HUD, and a reset button.
The in-game HUD reads out the current dread, each term that fed it, what is playing, and what the base ambience is playing, so you can see why a place sounds the way it does.

Requirements:
Anomaly 1.5.3
Modded exes: themrdemonized 20250908 or newer, or AOEngine v0.55 or newer. The full feature set needs the latest demonized build. A feature that needs a newer one stays inactive on older exes.
xlibs (plays the sounds, https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/xlibs-1001)
MCM (shows the settings and the trace)

Compatibility:
Depends only on xlibs. Install and uninstall mid-save work. Tested: Anomaly 1.5.3, GAMMA, EFP, Zona, Forgotten Zone.
Coexists:
- Any soundscape pack (Soundscape Overhaul, Dark Signal, and the rest) - the veto strips DiegeticDread's own sounds from the base channels at load, so nothing doubles.
- DiegeticAmbience - its companion: DiegeticDread plays the horror and vetoes it from the base, DiegeticAmbience owns the nature-and-weather bed.
It coexists with everything else.

How It's Built:

Although it started from work by Demonized, Alundaio, and Tronex, the current code and patterns are original, learned through reverse-engineering X-Ray, load testing, and custom X-Ray changes.
The design favors the engine's own mechanisms and minimal intervention, with event-native pub/sub over polling.
Work spreads across frames through deferred queues and rate limiters, while per-level caches replace world scans.
The raycasting and range math are hand-written and tested live, and the code follows the engine's own standards and flags.
Performance is the first invariant. Every flow stays under 2ms, and the build rewrites or drops anything that misses.
Profiled continuously with JitProfiler, an engine-native profiler. Manual tests run on unoptimized, single-threaded exes.
The code carries tracing and monitoring from the ground up, with every flow timed off the log level.
Every commit runs the full pipeline locally and in CI: luacheck, a Selene build compiled for STALKER with flags the public build lacks, and a load test that runs every script against engine stubs.
Rule layers then check crash safety, hotpath cost, engine correctness, complexity, architecture contracts, security, and the docs.
Every mod is configurable through MCM or LTX, down to each rate, threshold, and toggle, with nothing tunable left hard-coded.
The mod avoids writing engine values, holding its own state in parallel. Any value it must change stays inside the engine's own bounds, so save corruption is impossible.
The family runs on one rulebook through xlibs. Every rule, policy, and check is one shared implementation, the same protection, distances, faction logic, and combat reads in every mod.
It depends on no other mod, not even the author's own. The only shared layers are X-Ray and xlibs.

That pipeline runs on every commit and publishes what it finds. The header links a live health page and a JitProfiler capture of the mod's real CPU and allocation cost.

Credits:
Most of the sounds come from the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games and the standalone builds that carry and rework that audio.
Those builds: Solyanka (NS OGSR), Dead Air, OGSE, Prosector, NLC, OLR, Lost Alpha.
The rest is dark ambience from community soundscape packs, with thanks to their authors.
Shrike made the Dark Signal family and Amplified Soundscape. Solarint made Soundscape Overhaul.
Aphrodite_child and myRETUNE Antares made RETUNE. AniHVX made Audio Expansion.
Txiku made Ambient Extended. Kutee made Immersive Ambience Expansion. Real Distant Mutants Sounds rounds out the set.
Shrike also gave unreleased interior audio he made for Dark Signal and never released, exclusive to this mod.
Each source carries a free license, or its author gave permission for my mods, not tied to any one mod.
I credit every author above. I include only selected audio. If an author does not want their work included, I remove it.
licensing.md records each source's license and the granting author's permission. I include nothing without a free license or the author's consent.

Usage and License:
  Modpacks: allowed and encouraged. Keep the readme and license files.
  Addons, patches, integrations: allowed. Credit "DiegeticDread by Damian Sirbu" visibly on your mod page.
  Reproducing the implementation in other software: not allowed, even with credit.
  The full license is in the LICENSE file and on GitHub.

Diagnostics and reporting:
Every release goes through careful engineering and testing, but bugs can still slip through.
To report one, reproduce with debug logging on, and the world log where the mod has one.
First rule this mod out: reproduce with it off, then on. The cleanest test is this mod alone on vanilla and xlibs.
Send the traces on the Anomaly Discord, or file a defect on GitHub with the same information.
Attach xray.log, the mod log, the engine build, the modlist, and the load order.
For deep technical details and mechanisms, check the architecture docs on GitHub.
